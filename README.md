## Instructions

* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

## How I built the Memory Game
I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS.
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is loaded or refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a single game
* added effects to cards when they need to show, when they match and when they don't
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game or reload the game
