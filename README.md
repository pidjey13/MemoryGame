## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and use your memory to remember each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

## How I built the Memory Game
* Manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS
* Created a deck of cards that shuffle when the game is loaded or refreshed
* Created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a single game
* Added effects to cards when they need to show, when they match and when they don't
* Created with SweetAlert a pop-up modal when the player wins the game or reload
